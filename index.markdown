I am a computational biologist with strong interest in research and development of _in silico_ methods and tools for the effective exploitation and/or integration of biomedical omics data. Over the years I have built strong interdisciplinary skills bridging biology, clinical diagnosis, data science, and software development which I am eager to apply to new collaborations!

## Current position

Currently I am occupied as a post-doctoral researcher in bioinformatics in [biobank.cy](https://biobank.cy/), University of Cyprus. With the application of bleeding-edge and the development of novel algorithms I am analysing genetic diagosis cases for biobank.cy's Diagnostic department, while exploring the Cypriot genome using the rich genomics data of the Center.
