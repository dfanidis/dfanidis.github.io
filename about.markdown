I am a computational biologist with strong interest in research and development of _in silico_ methods and tools for the effective exploitation and/or integration of biomedical omics data. Over the years I have built strong interdisciplinary skills bridging biology, clinical diagnosis, data science, and software development which I am eager to apply to new collaborations!

### Short bio

I am a biologist by training with a Master's degree in Molecular Biomedicine. During my Master's I have worked with algorithms for transcriptomics data analysis developing code that enabled the creation of [metaseqR2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/metaseqR2.html), a complex Bioconductor package for RNA-seq data processing.

I earned my PhD from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, focusing on the development of in-silico methods for the study of pulmonary fibrosis. My work includes the creation of [Fibromine](http://fibromine.com), a widely used multi-omics database and mining platform. Applying explainable machine learning models on Fibromineâ€™s data I have successfully prioritized previously latent disease biomarkers. In addition, my research spans diverse omics data types such as genomics, transcriptomics (microarray, RNA-seq, single cell RNA-seq), and microbiomics. I have contributed singificant findings on epigenetic biomarkers in cancer, as well.

My [studies](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bMb5jOkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) have been published in high impact journals, while I have also co-authored a textbook chapter regarding biobanking.

Currently I am occupied as a post-doctoral researcher in bioinformatics in [biobank.cy](https://biobank.cy/), University of Cyprus. With the application of bleeding-edge and the development of novel algorithms I am analysing genetic diagosis cases for biobank.cy's Diagnostic department, while exploring the Cypriot genome using the rich genomics data of the Center.
