I am a biologist by training with a Master's degree in Molecular Biomedicine. During my Master's I have worked with algorithms for transcriptomics data analysis developing code that enabled the creation of [metaseqR2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/metaseqR2.html), a complex Bioconductor package for RNA-seq data processing.

I earned my PhD from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, focusing on the development of in-silico methods for the study of pulmonary fibrosis. My work includes the creation of [Fibromine](http://fibromine.com), a widely used multi-omics database and mining platform. Applying explainable machine learning models on Fibromineâ€™s data I have successfully prioritized previously latent disease biomarkers. In addition, my research spans diverse omics data types such as genomics, transcriptomics (microarray, RNA-seq, single cell RNA-seq), and microbiomics. I have contributed singificant findings on epigenetic biomarkers in cancer, as well.

My [studies](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bMb5jOkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) have been published in high impact journals, while I have also co-authored a textbook chapter regarding biobanking.
